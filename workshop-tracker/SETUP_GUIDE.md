# Workshop Tracker Setup Guide

## ðŸ”§ Database Migration Instructions

### Step 1: Apply Database Schema Migration

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to **SQL Editor**

2. **Run the Migration Script**
   - Copy the contents of `database-migration.sql`
   - Paste into the SQL Editor
   - Click **Run** to execute the migration

3. **Verify Tables Created**
   The migration will create these new tables:
   - âœ… `clients` - Customer information and payment tracking
   - âœ… `workshops` - Workshop events and scheduling  
   - âœ… `documents` - File upload metadata with Supabase Storage
   - âœ… `workshop_participants` - Many-to-many relationship table

4. **Enable Storage Bucket**
   - Go to **Storage** in Supabase dashboard
   - Verify the `documents` bucket was created
   - If not, create it manually with public access disabled

### Step 2: Test New Features

#### âœ… Who Paid Page Enhancements
- Navigate to `/who-paid`
- Test the **Internal Contributors** tab (expense/income tracking)
- Test the **Client Payments** tab (customer payment history)
- Verify filtering and export functionality

#### âœ… Document Upload System
- Navigate to `/documents`
- Test uploading files (PDFs, images, documents)
- Verify file categorization (invoice, receipt, contract, photo, other)
- Test download functionality
- Check admin vs user permissions

#### âœ… Profile Settings Improvements
- Navigate to `/profile`
- Test the new two-column layout
- Verify profile information editing
- Test password change functionality with validation
- Check profile preview updates in real-time

#### âœ… Navigation Fixes
- Verify "Add Class Type" is removed from Actions dropdown
- Confirm only "Manage Class Types" appears for admin users
- Test Documents link in main navigation

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "relation 'public.clients' does not exist"
**Solution:** Run the database migration script in Supabase SQL Editor

### Problem: "Could not find relationship between documents and uploaded_by"
**Solution:** The migration fixes this with proper foreign key constraints

### Problem: Storage upload fails
**Solution:** 
1. Check Storage bucket exists in Supabase
2. Verify RLS policies are applied
3. Ensure file size is under 10MB limit

### Problem: Client tab shows no data
**Solution:** This is expected initially - clients table starts empty. Add test clients through the admin interface.
